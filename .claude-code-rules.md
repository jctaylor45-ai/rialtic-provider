# Claude Code Rules for This Project

## Auto-Commit Rule

**Rule**: At the end of each prompt/task, automatically commit and push changes to the GitHub repository.

**Repository**: https://github.com/jctaylor45-ai/rialtic-provider

**Process**:
1. After completing any task or making changes
2. Stage all changes: `git add .`
3. Create a descriptive commit with proper message format
4. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

**Commit Message Format**:
```
Brief description of changes

```

**When to Skip**:
- If no meaningful changes were made
- If only reading/investigating code
- If user explicitly requests no commit

**Git Safety**:
- Never force push to main
- Never amend commits from other developers
- Always use descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate
