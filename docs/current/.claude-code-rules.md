# Claude Code Rules for Provider Portal

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Last Updated**: January 7, 2026 at 14:55 UTC

## Rule 1: Documentation Standards

### Documentation Structure

```
/
├── README.md              # Master document (ONLY doc at root)
└── docs/
    ├── current/           # Active documentation
    │   ├── INDEX.md
    │   ├── MEMORY.md
    │   ├── PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
    │   └── .claude-code-rules.md
    └── archive/           # Superseded documentation
        └── ARCHIVE_INDEX.md
```

### All Documentation Must Be Versioned

Every markdown file in this project MUST include a header with:

```markdown
**Version**: X.Y.Z
**Last Updated**: [Month Day, Year] at [HH:MM] UTC
**Status**: [Draft | Active | Deprecated | Archived]
```

### When Creating New Documentation

1. Always include version header (start at 1.0.0)
2. Always include last updated timestamp with date AND time
3. Include status field
4. Place in appropriate location:
   - Root: ONLY `README.md` (master document)
   - `docs/current/`: All active documentation
   - `docs/archive/`: Superseded documents

### When Modifying Documentation

1. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp
2. Increment version number:
   - Patch (0.0.X): Typo fixes, clarifications
   - Minor (0.X.0): New sections, significant updates
   - Major (X.0.0): Complete rewrites, major restructuring
3. If the document is being superseded, move to `docs/archive/` and update status to "Archived"

### Documentation Hierarchy

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | Root | Master document, project overview |
| `MEMORY.md` | docs/current/ | Comprehensive project context |
| `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | docs/current/ | Developer guide |
| `.claude-code-rules.md` | docs/current/ | AI behavior rules |

### Preventing Outdated Documentation Issues

1. **Never reference archived documents** for implementation decisions
2. **Always check document dates** before using specifications
3. **If a document is >30 days old**, verify it still reflects current implementation
4. **Archive documents immediately** when they become outdated
5. **Cross-reference `docs/current/MEMORY.md`** as the source of truth for current state

## Rule 2: Auto-Commit

### Commit at End of Each Task

After completing any task or making changes:

1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Create a descriptive commit with proper message format
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

### Commit Message Format

```
Brief description of changes

- Bullet point list of specific changes
- Include technical details when relevant
- Reference any issues or features

```

### When to Skip Commits

- If no meaningful changes were made
- If only reading/investigating code
- If user explicitly requests no commit

---

## Rule 3: Git Safety

- NEVER force push to main
- NEVER amend commits from other developers
- Always use descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate
- Verify remote status before pushing

---

## Rule 4: Code Quality

### Before Completing Any Task

1. Run `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript compiles
2. Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
3. Use existing patterns and composables when possible
4. Follow the established component structure

### Type Safety

- All new code must be TypeScript
- Use types from `types/index.ts` and `types/enhancements.ts`
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

---

## Rule 5: Data Integrity

### Mock Data Files

All data files in `public/data/` must:
- Be valid JSON
- Follow established interfaces from `types/`
- Include realistic, diverse data
- Have dates within appropriate ranges for the feature

### localStorage

- Use for user preferences and learning markers
- Never store sensitive information
- Clear outdated entries when data structures change
