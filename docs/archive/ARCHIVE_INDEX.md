# Documentation Archive

**Archived**: January 7, 2026
**Reason**: Superseded by current implementation or consolidated into active documentation

---

## Why These Files Are Archived

These documents were created during the initial development and migration phases of the Provider Portal. They have been archived because:

1. **Tech Stack Changed**: Original specs referenced React/Vite, but the project was migrated to Nuxt 3/Vue 3
2. **Implementation Complete**: Audit reports captured point-in-time snapshots that are now outdated
3. **Consolidated**: Key information has been merged into the current `MEMORY.md` and `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
